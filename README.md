# Accident-Analysis using Tableau
This research goals are mainly to explore the various methods to study the spatial distribution of accidents and identify traffic accident
hot spots for a certain region.

## Key Highlights:-
**1. Pivot Table Analysis**

- Vehicle type 805 has the highest number of alerts, totaling 6875.
- It becomes apparent that this particular vehicle type has encountered
  a substantial number of incidents or events warranting warnings,
  specifically related to headway monitoring and warning (HMW).

**2. Weekly ADAS Alert Overview**

- On examining the weekly report of various ADAS alerts, itâ€™s apparent that Headway Monitoring
  (HMW) consistently holds the highest alert count, while Forward Collision Warning (FCW) registers as
the lowest.
- FCW alerts typically activate when a vehicle is in close proximity to the one ahead, implying that drivers might generally
  maintain safe following distances or engage in less aggressive driving behaviors.
- Observing the weekly trend, it becomes evident that alert counts for all ADAS categories remain relatively
  high from Monday through Friday. However, HMW displays a notable uptick on Fridays, reaching a count of 2518.

**3. Vehicle Alert Time Distribution Analysis**

- We can observe the different alerts generated by the vehicles over the time period from 5 a.m.- 8 p.m.
- The greatest number of alerts corresponded to HMW alerts across all vehicle types, which have
  been highlighted in the figure.
- These HMW alerts exhibited significant peaks during two distinct time periods:
  7-8 am and 4-5 pm. These specific timeframes correspond to the morning and afternoon rush hours,
  which are characterized by heightened traffic activity due to work and school-related commutes.
- Traffic congestion is a common occurrence during these times, making it challenging for drivers to
  maintain a safe following distance between vehicles. The increased vehicle density on the road during rush
  hours also raises the likelihood of scenarios that trigger HMW alerts, such as tailgating and abrupt braking.
